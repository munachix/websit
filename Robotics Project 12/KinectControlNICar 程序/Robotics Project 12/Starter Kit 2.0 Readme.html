<h1>Starter Kit 2.0 Roaming Example</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to control the Robotics Starter Kit 2.0 robot 
with the Starter Kit API. The project contains a Simulation target and a 
Single-Board RIO target. The VIs in both targets use the same control algorithm.</p>
<h2>Simulation Target</h2>
<p>The Simulation target contains a VI that demonstrates how to use the Starter 
Kit API in the Robotics Environment Simulator.</p>
<h2>Single-Board RIO Target</h2>
<p>The Single-Board RIO target contains a VI that demonstrates how to use the 
Starter Kit API with a real robot.&nbsp; This example is configured to run on a 
Single-Board RIO 9632.&nbsp; You must also configure the IP address of the RIO 
target to match your network configuration. Select Help&gt;&gt;Search the LabVIEW Help 
and browse to the Robotics Module&gt;&gt;Reusing Robotics Examples topic on the 
Contents tab of the LabVIEW Help for information about adapting this example to 
fit the target you want to use.</p>
<p>The RIO target contains three test panel VIs you can use to test and 
calibrate the robot:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Calibrate Sensor Angle.vi</strong><br />
	Run this VI to adjust the sensor servo offset angle.&nbsp; Move the slider 
	back and forth until the sensor is facing forward, then click the Zero Angle 
	button.&nbsp; This VI saves calibration info on the RIO target, so you 
	should only need to run it one time, unless you reattach the sensor or 
	reformat the target.</li>
	<li><strong>Test Motors.vi<br />
	</strong>Run this VI to test the motors and encoders on the robot.&nbsp; 
	Moving the sliders should turn the wheels, and the velocities should be 
	updated on the graph.&nbsp; Make sure to elevate the robot so the wheels are 
	off the ground before running this VI.</li>
	<li><strong>Test Ultrasonic Sensor.vi</strong><br />
	Run this VI to test the ultrasonic sensor on the robot.&nbsp; Wave your hand 
	in front of the sensor to confirm that it properly detects obstacles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deploying a Startup Executable</h3>
<p>This example includes a build specification for a startup executable that can be deployed to the robot 
to run automatically when the robot is turned on:</p>
<ol>
	<li>In the project tree, locate the "Starter Kit 2.0 Roaming" item listed 
	under "Build Specifications". This is the build specification that compiles 
	the Starter Kit 2.0 Roaming.vi into a startup executable.</li>
	<li>Right click the build specification, and select "Build".&nbsp; The build 
	may take a few minutes to complete.</li>
	<li>Right click the build specification, and select "Run as startup". Click 
	"Yes" when prompted to reboot the sbRIO. The startup executable will run 
	each time the robot is turned on. It may take up to two minutes for the 
	startup executable to run, so be patient.</li>
</ol>
